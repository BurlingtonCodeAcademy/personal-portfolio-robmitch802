    "snippet": "Two candidates who were outspoken in their opposition to the refugee resettlement in Rutland won election to the Rutland Board of Aldermen on Tuesday, while four who were supportive of the resettlement won as well. Incumbent Tom DePoy, who was the top vote-getter, said he was most concerned about the signal the results of the mayoral race sends, and was looking to move the city forward. “To me the most important outcome is that transparency and respect are being returned to the mayor’s office,” DePoy said. “When the public feels they have been kept out of things, they don’t take very kindly to being left out of major decisions at City Hall.” Tim Cook, who also opposed the resettlement, also won, as did resettlement supporters Lisa Ryan, Chris Ettori, Rebecca Mattis and Melinda Humphrey."

    "snippet": "When Vermont played host to refugees from El Salvador in the late 1980s, often the families were afraid to go out after dark. In their native country, nighttime was when the death squads would arrive.

    In 1990, refugees from Romania shared stories of imprisonment by that country's secret police with Gov. Madeline Kunin. In the 1970s, a Vietnamese man arrived in Rutland with his 6-year-old son, one of a few dozen who fled the fall of Saigon and were sponsored by local church groups. The man, Nhan Huu Tran, had left his wife and three other children in Vietnam — but not by choice. They'd been separated during their flight from Communist forces.
    
    Throughout the 1980s, dozens more Vietnamese families came to Vermont, some escaping persecution for aiding the American cause in the war."

    "snippet":"A local couple whose truck went through a guard rail and into the East Creek on Friday night emerged from the water safely after a rescue by Rutland City firefighters. The truck carrying a man and a woman eastward down Crescent Street in Rutland City veered across Preville Avenue just before the Crescent Street bridge, caromed off a guard rail and went into the creek a little before 5 p.m. A call to 911 came from the couple inside the car, said Deputy Fire Chief Brad LaFaso. The caller told a dispatcher that the car was in the creek and water was filling quickly."

He had been dead for more than a decade, but he left behind a legacy of more than 10,000 editorials written over a 50-plus year career in journalism. I learned the art of editorial writing by reading hundreds of them, which spanned the days from the end of World War II all the way to the advent of the Internet. Until I started working in the business, I had lived in a newspaper family, but hadn’t really understood what he had accomplished. This 225th anniversary year marks the 84th year of my family’s involvement with the Rutland Herald."

        "snippet": "In section O, site 206, of the national military cemetery in Honolulu sits a grave marker for a Vermonter who died far from home, on Aug. 18, 1944. Ripley S. Buckingham was raised in Brandon, the great-grandson of Civil War hero W.Y.W. Ripley. He was originally buried near where he died in southern China, in a forgotten corner of World War II. His remains were moved to U.S. soil at some point during or after the war. Like many who died in that conflict, the story of his life is rapidly passing out of living memory. Living World War II veterans are dwindling in number, and their contemporaries — friends and relatives who knew them personally — are aging. The only record I have of Ripley’s war service, and much of his life, comes from mimeographed letters he wrote to his wife prior to his death. The couple spent a few short years together before he was commissioned into the Army Reserves in 1941 and shipped to China in 1943. Rip was a doctor, and he served as a liaison officer to the Chinese Army in southern China. He was killed, as I understand it, by a Japanese sniper as he rushed to aid another soldier. I know all this because his widow became my grandmother when she married my father’s dad, although she was not prone to talking about her first husband, 'Rip.'"
